# Nudge or Sexbolt Bed Top Mount

## Overview & Design
I tried the design from ___ and ___ and found my bracket was moving around a bit, and wanted something a bit more sturdy and perhaps simpler if possible.  I also wanted something that would work with the Nudge or Sexbolt alignment hardware because my Nudge was not working well until I got the copper M3x6 SHCS. 
Chages from original design:
* This design is stronger, with longer brackets to reduce bending
* 2 options to have bushings or no bushings.  I find that the one without bushings works well for me!
* Sexbolt or Nudge mountable
