# Nudge or Sexbolt Bed Top Mount

## Overview & Design
I tried the design from ___ and ___ and found my bracket was moving around a bit, and wanted something a bit more sturdy and perhaps simpler if possible.  I also wanted something that would work with the [Nudge](https://github.com/zruncho3d/nudge/blob/main/README.md) or [Sexbolt](https://mods.vorondesign.com/details/t1DBVlcUBbdEK6habEsVzg) alignment hardware because my Nudge was not working well until I got the copper M3x6 SHCS. 
Chages from original design:
* This design is stronger, with longer brackets to reduce bending
* Multiple attachment options for Nudge (side or down)
* 2 options to have bushings or no bushings.  I find that the one without bushings works well for me!
* Sexbolt or Nudge mountable
