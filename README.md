# Stealthchanger
My notes and files for Stealthchanger

It was difficult to figure out my stealthchanger build, and many things are confusing still.  Here's my setup:

Initial Voron 2.4 300 with Stealthburner

Plan to move to 4 toolheads, mostly dragonburner since it seems well supported by Stealthchanger already.

## Docking / Door Buffer / etc
